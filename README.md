# Internalize

The purpose of this project is to ease the transit of configuration
item data between a small IT managed services provider (MSP) and
its clients.

## Workflow

1. Once on the homepage, the client needs to register into the system.
2. The MSP approves the user attaching a client to it.
3. Once logged in, the approved user can manage its company's
   configuration items data and choose the ones that must be monitored.
4. From this point, the MSP has an updated list of configuration items
   with all information needed to manage them.
